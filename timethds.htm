          Timing methods developed by TTC R&D
        </H1>
        I have a
        <A HREF = "curnt-hw.htm">
          page
        </A>
        that describes in detail the hardware and software we are
        currently using

      The first method used to time riders
      <B>
        "Class 1"
      </B>
      of teacups was using a stop watch. By starting the timer while looking at
      the handle and stopping it when the handle gets to the same spot, you
      get a time per revolution. That was our first speed benchmark. The
      problem with that method is, when the speeds get up to where we are, the
      time per revolution gets too small to be accurate. The average time
      most people get (the ones trying to go fast) is about one second (100).
      The average time team T-Cups gets is about 0.70 seconds (70, pronounced
      "seven-oh").
      <P>

      The next level of timing we used
      <B>
        "Class 2"
      </B>
      was to use a laptop and press a key whenever you see the handle get
      straight between you and the cup (hence Teacup Timer 2.0). Then each
      touch of a key will record a time so they can be graphed out in real
      time and analyzed on site and later on. Then by looking at the graph
      we can find a more accurate speed. Other positives include, the ability
      to list time per revolution, rpm, g's, and the ability to see how an
      individual pulled.
      <P>

      Our next level of timing
      <B>
        "Class 3"
      </B>
      we used was to use a switch mounted on the stationary pole to which the
      wheel is attached. For keyboard input this switch is attached by
      wires to a stripped down keyboard's enter key (The keyboard is plugged
      into a PS/2 connection in the laptop) to simulate an enter key press.
      The laptop is placed either on the seat or underneath the seat or
      somewhere else safe. This is actually the most accurate method (at least
      with parallel input it is) since there is no human involvement in the
      procedure. But its not with out its drawbacks. It's hard to set up in
      the cup. The laptop is also in danger of being stepped on, hit, or just
      damaged by the G's or vibration of the cup on it's bearings.
      <P>

      The next level
      <B>
        "Class 4"
      </B> includes using a transmitter in the cup attached to the switch and
      a receiver connected to the stripped down keyboard (for keyboard input)
      which is connected to the laptop outside the ride.  This will
      be extremely close to as accurate as our previous method, although much
      more practical since the laptop will be outside the cup in the
      observation area. Having it outside also means the computer can be any
      bulky old 386 without being any nuisance to the team in the cup. Of course
      we don't really want to carry a desktop complete with 21 inch monitor
      into Disneyland. Cool as it would be to see our runs in 1600 res we
      already get enough looks carrying a laptop around. Because of the reasons
	stated, this method is much safer to the computer. This is our current
	preferred method of timing.
      <P>

      The highest level were working on is to use the compass feature on a GPS
      receiver to send out rotational positions to an ASIC equipped receiver
      which will stream the positions on to our web server by either Internet
      connection or direct radio transmission. The data will be viewed on site
      with a standard laptop connected to the Internet via celular modem. What
      the transmitter will be posting on the web server are the positions
      along with a time (ie. 24.432 deg. 23:31.345 GMT) in a file which the
      ASIC receiver will write to with an update every hundredth of a second or
      so. TCT will read and display that data on site via the web, same as anyone
	can at any location. The refresh rate
      will be as high as we can have it, however that is probably around 2
      or 4 frames a second, practically speaking. That should be enough though
      since it will be terribly accurate (± 0.002 seconds). We would also
      like to stream in 'Real TV', video of the run as its going (this would
      however dramatically reduce the refresh rates on the data down to the 2 -
      4 FPS). This way anyone can see in real time (well close enough) what
      the team is doing and what it looks like. Were this implemented you
      would be seeing the data being graphed out of a run which we were
      pulling right now along with live video of the crowd cheering us on in
      the latest release of TCT.
      <P>
      We hope to have the data viewable via Internet connection in a later
      release of TCT probably around TCT '99. 
      <P>
      Well maybe not. But we're working in it. Above all though, we think it
      would be
      really cool.<P>
	<FONT size="-2">This page was origionally written in 1997. The
	concepts we designed origionated around 1995-1997. Currently, 08FEB2004,
	TTC is pretty much defunct, but I have most of the technologies working
	for me in one way or another, just not in a TCT release. TCT and TTC
	played a crucial roll in developing these technologies for use in my
	personal and profesional projects.
