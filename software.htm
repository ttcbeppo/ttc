        Teacup Timer 2.1
      </H1>

      This is our primary data analysis and timing program for the teacups.
      <P>
      Teacup Timer 2.1 includes these features:

      <UL>
        <LI>
          Timing function operated by keypresses.
        <LI>
          Save runs.
        <LI>
          View saved run data(Seconds, RPM, G's and other useful info).
        <LI>
          Replay runs in a variety of playback speeds.
      </UL>

	  Teacup Timer 2.5
	</H2>

	This is basicaly TCT2.1 but with a few additions. It has a selector for keyboard,
	mouse, or parallel input and the clock frequency. When you are at the top of the
	root menu and hit the up arrow the selector moves to the bottom and likewise if
	you are on the bottom and hit the down arrow the selector goes to the top (a
	seemingly minor thing but i love it)

      <FORM METHOD   = "GET"
            ACTION   = "software/tct25.zip">

      <H2>
        Teacup Timer 3.0 (PreAlpha version 1)
      </H2>

      This is just a sort of sneak preview of T-cup Timer version 3.
      It has much of the graphics stuff done, but needs the timing functions
      to be written and the different input devices need to be handled.
      <BR>
      It is not very functional at this time, but it gives you a chance to
      see what it will look and function like. Right now it will create a
      new run but it wont save it yet. This is very PRE alpha.

      The program designed by Team T-Cups, for Team T-cups!
      <BR>
      This is our primary data analysis program.  It can be taken in to
      disneyland on a laptop and run from the outside of the ride by the
      designated timer.

      CONAN.EXE (MS-DOS, 67k)

      The ultimate Conan conquers everything game! This is a side scrolling
      game that I made so I could learn how to use mode 13h graphics. I 
      also implemented  some of Teacup Timer's time routines in it to try
      and keep it running at a fixed speed. Let me know if it does or not if
      you'd like, cause I've never  tested it on a slow machine.
