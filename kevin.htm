      Kevin was one of the first members of TTC. He was pulling on the cups
      before anyone else with Brian "Fro no mo" Magnesun. He has undoubtedly
      ridden the cups more times than any one else in the team, and extremely
      likely more than anyone else in the world! While he was pulling with the
      team he was the #1 top puller in the world. Next to me he holds the most
      records I know exist. He quite likely has gone the fastest of anyone in
