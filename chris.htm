      Hello, my name is Chris Adams, otherwise known as Lucifer to my friends.
      I am one of the people in this team that many people would not expect to
      be. In a group of clean cut, respectable people, such as Team T-cups I
      kind of stick out among them.
      <P>

      While in the T-cups, there seems to be an outside force compelling me to
      pull hard and go the fastest that I possibly can. The feeling that I get
      while pulling hard is one of complete exhilaration and excitement. Many
      times I have the music of Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Dirty Rotten
      Imbeciles, Nofx, and many other hardcore or fast paced music. These
      kinds of music often help me to pull the hardest and set a pace for me
      to pull fast.
      <P>

      When I first went to Disneyland and pulled on the Mad Hatter Tea-Party
      I was immediately addicted. After The first time paying for a ticket I
      decided to get an annual pass. I was and still am to this date
      completely enthusiastic about  being an annual pass holder (otherwise
      known as a "Disneyland local" to the majority of pass holders). Being
      in Team T-cups keeps me happy and energetic for the extent of my stay
      there which makes me want to remain a Disneyland local for the remaining
      years of my life.
      <P>

      There are a few things that we do to keep a little monotony and
      predictability in our actions. If we didn't have these things to follow
      we would be lost in  our ways of doing new things every time we went
      off the cups.

      <UL>

        <LI>
          The first thing I do, is Get a drink of water
        <LI>
          Second, we accept the compliments of how fast we went
        <LI>
          Next, we check the time that was just recorded
        <LI>
          Finally, we go to the restroom and check how bloodshot our eys are
