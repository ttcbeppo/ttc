        The program designed by Team T-Cups, for Team T-cups!<BR>
        This is our primary data analysis program.  It can be taken in to Disneyland
        on a laptop and run from the outside of the ride by the designated timer.

        The ultimate Conan conquers everything game!  This is a side scrolling game
        that I made so I could learn how to use mode 13h graphics.  I also implemented
        some of Teacup Timer's time routines in it to try and keep it running at a 
        fixed speed.  Let me know if it does or not if you'd like, cause I've never 
        tested it on a slow machine.
