      The software that we currently are using is TCT 2.5. Because the laptop
      we are using won't handle setting the clock to handle high resolutions we
      would like to use, we need to be able to set them down. So we added a
      configuration screen to select the sampling rate. We also added a few
      little things like the ability to wrap the menu selector around so if
      your at the top you can hit up and it will jump to the bottom. Quite
      simple but I think it really makes a difference. You can also select if
      you would like to use keyboard or parallel input. There are also a few
	other improvements and bug fixes so we just decided to call it 2.5.
      <P>

      The hardware we are using will take a little more explanation. We are
      finally at a point where it really looks professional. The switch is all
      precision machined, the receiver and transmitter are in really good
      looking cases (we used to just have everything hanging out in the open),
	and all the wiring has BNC or the proper connector on it.
      No more soldering everything for temporary use. Brian finally put a LED
      on the transmitter that blinks when the switch is actuated. This really
      really   helps us to see if we have positioned the switch properly. This,
      in fact, most likely made the difference when we recorded our first class
      4 run. I haven't mentioned this run 'cause Brian went home after we
      recorded it and tried to "improve" the laptop and blew it up. So I can't
      share it with you so I figure theres no sense in mentioning it. And now I
	doubt we will ever show it cause i accidentally dropped the hard drive
	that it was on (the laptop is long gone but i kept the hdd). So the only
	way that i will ever get it up for download (or for our viewing for that
	matter) is to send the hdd into a data recovery place. Being as how I
	don't even have cash for a pass that is unlikely to happen anytime soon
	though.
