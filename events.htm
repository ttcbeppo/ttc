            Beppo didn't have a good enough grip of the seat and
            slipped halfway out of the cup.  He managed not to completely
            fly out, but suffered the consequences.  His vision turned
            milky white (weird! pilots usually get "red eye" where there
            vision turns progressively red until they cant see anything and
            if they keep pulling

            was so filled with blood that he had blood splotches all over his
            face that looked like bad zits, and he had extremely bloodshot
            eyes (and I mean extremely bloodshot) for about two weeks. And

              Team T-Cups crack the blue cup.

            Beppo, Brian, Kevin and Konrad went on the blue cup and pulled
            around a .65 or .7 and midway through the ride the cup started
            cracking all around the base of the seat.  Brian moved about 1.5
            inches backward and was scared shitless for a second, but then
            they just started cheering as if they'd just acomplished
            something great. So they started pulling even harder! Then the
            door flew open outward (the doors are supposed to open inward).

            This was the first day that the whole team was there (except
            Konrad of course) with the working timing hardware and software.
            Naturally, everyone had the adrenaline flowing. Kevin, Brian and
            Beppo went on the purple cup while Eric timed from the laptop.

              Class 2</A>
            timing method, that's why it was estimated and not exact.  The
            response by our audience was amazing!  It was our greatest moment
            as Team T-cups to date.  The crowd was beginning to clap and
            cheer even as Beppo was just finishing as the first puller!  It
            continued and grew stronger throughout the run (Brian pulled mid

            finished, they went nuts!!! We then walked out while everyone was
            staring at us and telling us how amazingly fast that was. Even
            today (yes 2001 today) that was the single greatest day in TTC history.

            Sorry folks, but we're having difficulty with memory handling
            with our current compiler. That means that either we need to get
            a new compiler, or we need to find out how to program around this
            limitation.
            <BR>
            Hopefully we'll have a bit of extra time soon because of the
            holiday to try and get it all worked out. As soon as we get that
            taken care of, we'll be plowing forward once again trying to get
            T-Cup Timer 3.0 available for use by us, and for download by you!

            We're posting a very early test version (prealpha 1) just to let
            you get an idea of what 3.0 will feature and how it will look.
            There's not much finished yet, but much of the graphics stuff has 
            been taken care of.  Next will be the timing functions
            themselves, then the different input devices will be taken care
            of. Teacup Timer 3.0 alpha 1 is available for download on our 
            <A HREF="software.htm">
              software page.
            </A>
            Despite it's prealpha stage we've seen it to be very stable.
            I run it in win95 (full screen of course) and it works great, even
            if im using other programs like winamp or something.

              Brian M finds new compiler
            </FONT>
            <P>
            Brian finally downloaded DJGPP, a freeware 32 bit compiler, which
            will allow him to use larger amounts of memory (more than 640kb).
            It will however take a bit of time to port it over (we do have
            jobs and lives to take care of along with other projects).. Another
            note is DJGPP uses gcc which is the native linux compiler. This will
            make it that much easyer to port it to linux (my default operating
            system). TCT is curently DOS only. Brian is working on a windows
            version, but that won't be available for quite some time (maybe next
            year ... or two).

            TTC gets a new really trick switch

            <P>
            I finally took out a few minutes to design and build a new quality
            switch mount. Our last one was al of about 30 seconds design and
            about the same amount of time in construction. This switch mount is
            all precision machined (I am a machinist for a living, well a mold
            maker, saying I'm a machinist is like saying an automotive engineer
            is a mechanic) and looks really cool.So now TCT is working beutifully.
            A while ago we got the transmitter and reciever working bad ass,
            except that we have a .05 accuracy in the system, but the radio part
            is working great. The laptop we are using cant handle setting the
            clock where we can get resolutions lower than .05 er so anyway. So it
            really doesn't pose that much a problem until we sport for a better laptop.

            up for those with
            <A HREF = "http://www.solidworks.com" TARGET = "_top">
              Solidworks or the Solidworks viewer
            </A>
            pretty soon. That is after all what I'm drawing it up in `cause it
            allows me to save directly in VRML 2.0 and I use it a lot at my work.
            With Solidworks you can even go in and take measuments on the
            cup that I took myself to around .005" accuracy, just incase you
            want to make a T-Cup yourself. I am working on building a cup myself
            so we can train at home, which I hope will be done by the end of
            the year. This cup won't much be like the cups at D-Land at all.
            It will be built out of advanced composite materials and ride on
            roller bearings. Making the fastest (and most dangerous)
            cup the world will ever see. I will, however, have an electric
            dynomometer kind'o thing on it so we can restrict and accurately
            measure our speed and force we put out. That should make it so we
            don't spin into orbit and fly out and bonk our precious noggins.

            Very little has happened with us. As of right now the only one hard core enough
	    to have a pass is Kevin. None of us have enough money :( None of us have even talked
	    to Brian "go no mo" Magnusen in something like a year. Of course all of us
	    plan on getting passes soon (er at least say we plan on it haha). Oh and um..
	    I hav'nt done Jack on the carbon fiber cup I was planing on making.

		Now no one at all has a pass. This is the first time in nearly 7 years that no one
		has a pass at all! We are still a couple of broke-ass-loser guys that dont make

		It now has been years seince anyone has had an anual pass or has so much as gone to

		be described as tourist visits). It is neraly imposible to not say that Team T-Cups
		has gone to pasture and is now a has been. :(

		Chef and beppo went for a few medeocre runs (were just getting back into it, it'll
		take us some time before we can get back to our .70 status) on the cups. When they
		exited the ride two younger girls (well young to our aging selves hehe) came up and
		asked if we would take them on a ride. This has actually only happened to me (beppo)
		3 times that I can remember when total strangers saw us pulling a run and wanted us
		to take them for a ride. And two of the times they were girls who probably were just
		trying to flirt with one of the guys. The other time was when a guy about 9 er 10 came
		up to me and Brian asking to come on a run. Haha we pulled a medium to somewhat fast
		run (probably a .75) and after the run the lil guy had this look on his face like he
		had just found out santa wasn't real. He said thank you and stumbled off with his mom
		who was grinning ear to ear as if very proud of her son that he didn't vomit all over
		us. This time the two girls were with a few of their friends and shared some enthusiasm
		about the team when I went ranting on about times of past. Maybe we will see eachother
		again. The one gal (I am writing this a month later and can't remember thier names) was
		saying how she wanted to be a member of the team.

		As of right now, beppo, Lucifer, Les-the-chicken-breast, God, and Sadis ALL have passes!
		Aaron is currently in search of a job and therefore a pass is rather secondary. But that
		may change soon. Talk has already begun of a ttc reunion. The team will never see times
		such as in our hey-day, but maybe there are still some .60 runs left in us.
