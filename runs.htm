      This is our record setting run!  Pulled in the purple cup using a
      <A HREF="timethds.htm">
       class 2</A>
      timing technique.  Notice how inaccurately it was timed due to human
      error. Click on the small image to view a full sized one and read some
      notes on the run.

      This run was timed inside the pink (peach if it's night time) cup using a

      timing technique.  Notice how smooth it is compared to a human timed run.  Click on

      I dug this one up from deep in the archives. I dont even know any history on it.
      I don't think it was our only Class 4 run cause that run was done with a low
      resolution and this one has a very good resolution. This run has a resolution
      of probably .0005 seconds, Based on the raw data. At least the recording of it.
      It's real noisy at the start but that was surely before we started the run during
      setup.
