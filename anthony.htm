      IT WAS THE SUMMER OF 96 WHEN I JOINED THIS TEAM.  WITH MY INCREDIBLE
      SIZE AND STRENGTH I GAVE THE TEAM TONS OF POWER, I LEFT AND WENT BACK TO
      BEING A OGRE IN THE BACK WOODS OF MICHIGAN........... BUT NOW I HAVE
      RETURNED WITH AVENGENCE AND MORE POWER THAN EVER BEFORE. I WILL PUT ALL
      THE  POWER OF MICHIGAN IN MY PULLING AND WILL MAKE THE TEACUP SPIN LIKE
      NO HUMAN HAS SEEN BEFORE!!!
