      Ripping open hurts. Don't do it. See
      <A HREF = "defs.htm">
        The definition
      </A> page for the definition of ripping open.
      <P>

      We don't have much research into ripping open, so there isn't much I can
      say here. A method I use is to pull with my fingertips instead of my palm.
      Still grasping the handle in a normal fashion, except pulling up to apply
      the pressure to your fingertips. No one has ever ripped open their
      fingertips yet. This makes it very difficult to put in a lot of force
      though, so we only use this technique when our hands start hurting. That,
      however, could be after 5 seconds of pulling on our warm up run (the first
      run of the night to get us used to the extreme environment experienced during a run). If we feel
      our hands ripping apart we'll usually stop. But if everyone else in the
      cup is dead (meaning they have no more energy left) then we might try to
      engineer a method to pull. This sometimes will put us out for like a week
      though. But it's all in the name of science :D
