        So, you think your teacup spinning's pretty good huh?
        <BR>
        We want to challenge you and your team!
        <P>

      <DIV ALIGN = "CENTER">
        <H1>
          We are the undisputed champions!
        </H1>
      </DIV>
      <P>

      We would like to see what your team is made of, just before we spin circles around
      your cup.  So just in case you really think you can put on a decent competition, we
      will bring our timing software and hardware (unless you're
      <B>
        hard core
      </B>
      enough to have
      your own) and race you.
      <HR>
      <P>

      <DIV ALIGN = "CENTER">
        <H1>
          How do you set up a challenge?
        </H1>
      </DIV>
      <P>

      To set up a challenge time just E-mail us at
      <A HREF = "mailto:ttcbeppo@netscape.net"> ttcbeppo@netscape.net
      </A>
      with the date and time to meet at the cups to race. We will get back to you ASAP.
      <P>

      <DIV ALIGN = "CENTER">
        <H1>
          What is the prize?
        </H1>
      </DIV>
      <P>

      If by some miracle your team actually defeats Team T-Cups fair and square, we will
      actually post your whole team on our web site above ours and state that you are
      the champions of the sport!  Also we will treat you to pizza at place of your choice,
      where we will proceed to ask you what kind of intense training you went through to
      actually beat us.
