      Everyone has their own technique for pulling on the cups. They are
      each as unique as each of us are. Each representing not only each others
	individual personality but their physique. The only best technique for you
      is the one you develop for yourself. None the less I will try to
      explain the techniques we use and have used and honed down by
      years of experience and R&D.
      <P>

      Beppo and Chef:
	<BR>The one that seems to work best for us (about 140 lbs
	5'10'' and pretty long arms), is to keep your hands crossed and pull
	with both arms as hard as you can pressing against the cup with your
	feet. The force is provided by your back
	and butt and the backs of your upper legs (don't hurt yourself though).
	Your butt should almost leave the seat. When you move forward, take
	your left hand off and push with your right hand. When your hand gets
	the farthest it can from you, grab the handle with your left hand on
	the right of your right hand (crossing your arms). And start pulling
	as hard as you can again. This is the method used by most people in TTC.
      <P>

      Fro No Mo:
	<BR>Brians method ('bout 6 feet tall 180 lbs with quite long arms) is to
      lay slightly to his right, rest on the side, and pull in a hand over
      hand manner, one hand at a time, straight at him. He does seem to
      <A HREF = "defs.htm">
        rip open
      </A>
      a little more than everyone else. This might be from his method. It
      might be because his hands aren't very tough.
      <P>

      God:
	<BR>Kevin (5' 6'' 190 lbs with short arms) had 2 styles he would use in one
      run (keep in mid you only pull for about 30 seconds, the run lasts
      about 90 seconds). First he would pretty much stand up and sit on the
      rim (this really pisses off the operators and he doesn't do it any
      more), and pull with the same method me and Chris use. After about 10
      - 15 seconds we would really be moving and he would slide down and lean
      in over the center and twist the handle like a steering wheel on a car
      with a hand over hand motion.
      <P>

      Michigan Torque:
	<BR>Anthonys technique is elegant only in its utter simplicity. Plain
	and simple, Anthony (a body builder with short arms) just twisted
      the handle as hard as he could. He would start the run out, so he would grab
      the handle with his left hand on the left side, and his right hand on
      the right side and twist the cup around with a butt-load of force. It
      takes a lot of force to move the cups fast, and he is the only one that
      can make that method work that I've ever seen. He really didn't go very
      fast above a .80 though. I attribute this to how he really never needed
      to develop a technique for top end, as there was always some one else
      who did just fine, so he never did. Technique, quite simply, is what
      makes the puller fast.
