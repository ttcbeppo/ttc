     A typical run actually begins before we even leave for Disneyland. First
     we need to gather our hardware and laptop and put them into our official
     Team T-Cups Backpack. Then we'll cruise on up the freeways crankin' the
     tunes again until we get there. Once we're there if it's Friday or
     Saturday we'll usually head over to the swing band and regret
     that we don't know how to swing.

     First we need to set up the hardware to start recording. This can be a
     daunting task sometimes when it starts to act up. After all goes well
     and the hardware is working good enough, we'll conceal the transmitter
     in some jacket or something (we don't want to just go walking around
     D-Land with such a suspicious looking device or we might get beat to the
     ground by security thinking it's a bomb), grab a stick off some bush for
     the switch, and go get in line for the T-cups. If we don't forget, we'll
     do some stretching and everyone in line will stare at us. We always wait
     for the current fast cup, so if someone else before us gets it before we
     can get there we'll wait for the next ride. Once we get in the cup we'll
     pull up our sleeves (very important :D ) and
     do some last minute stretching and

     When the ride starts, the middle and top end pullers will start the cup
     with one or two big pulls, then the bottom puller will start. The middle
     puller will kick in when the bottom puller gets tired. By this time if
     the pullers are doing good and the crowd is fairly decent we will start
     getting people looking and talking about us. Then when the top end
     puller kicks in, many people will be noticing us and pointing at us and
     on a lot of runs applause will start up already. One other thing fairly
     common, is that the people in the cups next to us will start talking to
     us, saying things like: how do you go that fast, and are you guys ok, and
     you guys are going so fast! When the top end puller gets tired, one of
     the other two will pull until they get tired,
     then whoever feels like pulling will do so until the ride ends.

     If the run was pretty good, the applause often (hopefully) start up.
     Next comes the most difficult part of the run... gathering up all the
     hardware. This is not as easy as it might seem cause we need to do it
     quickly as there are other people waiting in line waiting for us to get
     out. And being a bit dizzy and maybe a bit woozy doesn't help much either.
     As we walk silky smooth out of our cup (the sign of a true T-Cup member),
     people will almost always talk to us. One of the most rewarding things is
     when a ride operator comes over and says that we just went the fastest
     that he/she has ever seen anyone go (that's happened many many  times by
     the way by just about every operator young or old). Next thing we do is
     go over to the very nearby drinking fountain(this fountain is now gone
	so we go straight to the bathroom and use the one behind it after
	 checking our eyes) and refresh ourselves.
     Getting a drink is probably the best, most important ritual we have. The
     next thing we will do is go over and see if our run recorded right, and
     if it did we'll see just how fast we went. Who pulled how hard, how well
     our latest technique we might have been testing worked, and if it was a
     record. The last thing we do is go to the nearby restroom and check our
     eyes to see how filled with blood they are on account of all the
     <A HREF = "gs.htm">
       Gs
     </A>
     we pull.
     <P>

     Then after a while we'll most likely go on some other rides. After all we
     can't ONLY ride the cups ... can we?
