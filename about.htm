          A brief history
        </H1>

      <HR> 

      Team T-Cups (formerly team green) started out as Brian Magnusen and
      Kevin pulling mediocre runs back in 1995 or so. Then they convinced
      most of their friends to get annual passes too. These new members were
      introduced to the intensity of fast runs on the cups as Brian and Kevin
      already knew. Then I (never content with just being the best) started
      timing people with the stopwatch on my watch in order to find out
      exactly how fast we were going. Once we knew that, we could accurately
      find out the best method for each of us to pull. Summer came and the
      whole team started going almost every day! Every night we'd pull a
      minimum of 2 runs each after watching Voyager play at the Tomorrowland
      Terrace. Then one day we were all talking about the team, I suggested
      making a web page for it. Only to have everyone laugh. But they
      changed their mind when we downloaded WYSIWYG software and were dying
      to check it out. So we spent the better part of a night trying to make
      a cheesy page that didn't even come close to making it on the web. Take
      it to me to learn enough HTML to code up a cheesier version of the site
      your seeing now. At first it had only text links and the image on the
      start page wasn't animated (it still has the same image, just animated
      now). Then after while me and Brian decided to have a contest to make
      the best page. Bear in mind this was shortly after the Internet
      explosion and web authors were few and far between, so it seemed like a
      good idea to learn HTML at the time. WYSIWYG programs were in the
      hundreds of dollars that we weren't going to spend (the program we used
      for the first ill fated page was an alpha of navigator gold) so we had
      to code by hand (still do). The image on the start page that says coded
      with notepad is still true. My page was the one to use all the latest
      coding techniques and technology. Brian, the only one with an Internet
      connection on account of my living on a boat, would basically take what I
      had and refine it and make it look a little better. Soon after we got to
      work on the site, we decided to make a timing program for PC's to find
      out the exact speed that we were going and to analyze our runs
      thoroughly. At first we just used a stopwatch to find out the speed
      (introduced by yours truly the founder of TTC R&D, the part of TTC that
      makes us what we are by introducing the technologies and advanced
      pulling techniques). Then we decided to make hardware to time our runs
      even more accurately. The hardware was agreeably the most difficult
      engineering challenge for our limited knowledge of electronics.
      Hopefully that will change when Brian is comfortable with his knowledge
      of microprocessors. He is after all taking college courses on the
      subject. So he will undoubtable be the electronics expert very shortly
      if he isn't already there. Brian is definitely the best at coding C++
      and assembly. He after all coded TCT 1.0 through TCT 3.0 and above.

          Who are we?

      Probably the most happinin' folks in the Magic Kingdom, Team T-Cups
      consists of highly trained, extremely intelligent (well most of us),
      and most importantly very good-looking college aged annual passholders
      who reside in Orange County CA (mostly in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach).
      We spend almost every weekend, and many weekday evenings on The Mad
      Hatter Tea Party pulling the fastest runs anyone has ever seen. All who
      see us are simply amazed that anyone can go as fast as we do. Perhaps
      more importantly that any one would care to go this fast. Or that
      anyone would dedicate so much time and money into something as seemingly
      useless as this. But that's hardly the case. When we started TTC we knew
      considerably less of computers, the related electronics, physics, and
      the effects of G's on all parts of the body.

      <DIV ALIGN = "CENTER">

          Why do we do it?
        </H1>
      </DIV>
      <HR>

      What are we thinking? Are we seriously lacking in the life
      department? And if we aren't why do we do it? Hell even if we are
      why do we do it?!
      <P>

      All good questions to someone not in or around the team. But first,
      to answer the most asked question. Do we have lives elsewhere? Yes
      of course we do. T-cups isn't the only way we spend our time. It's
      just the only thing we all have in common worth writing a web site
      about.
      <P>

      So why do we do it? What could be so great about the cups that we
      spend so much time and money on them? That's the GoLdEn question.
      For the ones pulling in the cup, it's something anyone who races
      would know about and that's all the explanation they need. I myself
      (Beppo) have raced go carts, motocross, sport bikes, BMX, models of
      all sorts, and drag raced cars and motorcycles. I can honestly
      say T-cups is not all that different from any of those sports,
      especially drag racing. The thrill of competition is there. Pulling
      fast runs can be equally as satisfying as winning races.
      <P>

      An intelligent challenge is also there.Which bring us to TTC R&D.
      The part of TTC that makes us TTC. Quite simply there is a strong,
      never ending, engineering challenge. After all you can always go faster.
      But how fast are we going? We developed the T-cup timer (TCT) to answer
      that question. But first versions were just too crude. TCT 1.0 was all
      command line. So for 2.0, a simple GUI was developed along with a
      graphing function. A major bug in the accuracy was also fixed. Right now
      the GUI is getting developed to where it actually looks like a really
      good looking program. Not just a simple, functional, ugly, application.
      The hardware is safer, tougher, and very reliable and very
      accurate (well sometimes it is). When we started TTC we knew nothing
      about computers. I didn't know a single dos command. And in around 2
      months of the existence of TTC R&D I was coding this site and Brian
      coded TCT. This is real progress. In fact Brian says he learns more in
      TTC R&D then he has learned at college. He learns more on his days off
      than when he's in class. The thrill of victory is an extremely strong
      motivation to learn as much as you can. To not just be the best in a
      certain class but to be the best in existince.
      <P>

      So that sums up a few reasons for our passion for TTC. Althogh
      that IS just a few. There are many many other very strong positives.
      More than I want to list off here. Far more than you want to read
      here. More in fact then we will know about until we stop this race
      of genius, muscle, aerobics, and above all narcisism. Yes we do get
      alot of B.S. about trying to be the fastest riders on the most
      popular ride in the most popular theme park in the world. But hey,
      we're having a lot of fun. And in the process becoming more
      knowledgeable about many very usable technologies. Everything from
      remote data aquisition to live streaming video (and simultaneous voice,
      video, and data streaming) to microprocessors to wireless communications
      to remote control to web content design to satalite communications.
      As well as how ones body responds in a sustained high G environment.
      Even aroebic and aneroebic capabilitys and ways of enhancing them.
