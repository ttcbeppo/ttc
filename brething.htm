      No matter what, your muscles need oxygen. They simply won't move
      without it. The best way to get it is to breath. But breathing in a
      high G environment is extremely difficult. Under high Gs blood rushes
      away from the center of the cup squeezing your lungs making it very
      difficult to inhale. The technique that usually work best for us is to
      breath like a fighter pilot. While the method we use was developed for
      positive G applications, where it keeps O2 in your brain while the blood
      runs away from your head, it works well for our application because of
      our high energy expenditure. It keeps blood near our muscles the same way
	it keeps blood near a fighter pilots brain. Our technique is to pretty much to
      hyperventilate before we pull. That gets as much O2 in our blood stream
      as we can. We breath as deep and as fast as we can and compress the air
      in our lungs and breath out as fast as we can. It is a very violent
      breathing method and shouldn't be done for any length of time while you
      aren't pulling Gs as you will quickly pass out, but it seems to help
      our longevity on a run. When we get in and pull we slow down the
      aggressiveness of our breathing rate to help us concentrate on how hard we
      are pulling so we don't rip open. Ripping open sucks. This breathing
      technique is best for our no pacing, one at a time, pull as hard as
      physically possible pulling technique. It may not be the best method for
      your pulling technique though. Because of the high Gs some method
      is needed. Most people we take on rides complain they cant breath. It's
      the main reason people tell us to stop. It's also the #1 reason team
      members ask us to stop pulling. That or we're too tired to get out of
