      The only member to actually have worked in Disneyland, Jenni will have an
      edge on us all until we each do the same. She has been with us from the
      get go back when we weren't much of a team but just some kids going to
      Disneyland. She was in the record setting cup with Beppo and les when they
      pulled a .50. She has been in the cup when we made just about every record
      setting run . She is someone who certainly doesn't need to read the

      Before she went to Las Vegas never really pulled, just sat in the cup and
      cheered us on. But now she's back and willing to pull. Easily the best
      looking member, she is indeed a very nice addition to the team.
