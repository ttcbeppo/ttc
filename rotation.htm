	This is actually very important to go fast. There are two turrets
	that the cups are on of relevance here. First There's the major turret.
	On the major turret, there sit 3 minor turrets. On each minor turret
	sit 5 cups (so how many cups does the ride have). But as far as each
	individual cup is concerned, there is a major, and minor turret. I mean
	who cares how fast the other guys riding the cups go? The major turret
	spins COUNTER clockwise when your looking down at it. The minor turret
	spins clockwise.
	<P>

	The major turret doesn't rotate all that fast, rpm wise, so it really
	doesn't have that much effect here (it does effect Gs though). But the
	minor turret spins at something like approximately 8 rpm (very
	approximate). At a 1.00 you are spinning 60rpm at which the minor turret
	is spinning at 13%, or at 120rpm, the fastest that TTC has ever been clocked,
	.50, the minor turret is spinning at 7% of the cup speed. So considering that the handle
	is connected to it, it is relevant. However because we are talking about
	two different directions, the ratio of effectiveness over the speed you go
	is doubled. When you spin counter clockwise, (again when looking down)
	the handle seems to move much faster while you actually aren't moving
	very fast at all. So it takes more horsepower to turn it. The
	definition of horsepower is speed times force. The equation to figure
	out horsepower is torque in foot lbs * rpm / ~5252. Knowing that you
	know that the faster the handle is moving the more horsepower, or
	energy, it takes to spin the cup. So the slower the handle is moving in
	relation to you the longer you can pull. Also the faster a muscle
	moves, the less force it can put out. Something bicyclists know all too
	well. As a result, the slower the handle moves in relation to you the harder
	you can pull it.
	<P>

	Another factor is that when you spin the cup backwards
	the bearings are moving faster, so there is more drag. As a result it
	takes more force to speed the cup up. Something you don't have anyway
	at the speeds your arm is moving.
	<P>

	We typically go around .75 going
	clockwise and .85-.90 going counter clockwise.
