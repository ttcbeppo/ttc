            Dead People = People who go on a run just for the ride and don't

            The Zone = The speed between approximately 1.0 - .85 where you get
            sick extremely easy. Also see
            <A HREF = "thezone.htm">

            "Feeling on" = when you feel like we can rip the cup off its
            bearings by yourself and go spinning into orbit like a UFO.
          <P>

          <LI>
            G's = Short for gravity. The force you feel while accelerating.
            We typically feel
            around 7 - 10 g's peak* from centrifugal force, depending on how
            fast we go. Those numbers are for .80-.65. At 2 g's 150 lbs.
            = 300 lbs 8gs = 1200*.
          <P>

          <LI>
            Rip open = When you pull really hard and you tear the skin on
            your hand. This is a serious matter that greatly limits our
            ability to pull really hard for extended periods of time.
            It happens to one member or another almost every night.

        <font size="-2">* peak actually refers to the rim of the cups. The Gs we feel decreases the
        closer you get to the center. If the center of gravity of an
        object is central to the center of rotation there is no centrifugal
        force applied. If you put your head directly over the wheel you can
        stay in indefinitely, as there is no force drawing you outward, but
	the Gs build up really fast when it gets
        off center and quickly forces your head to the side of the cup and
        that can hurt when you smack against the rim. Since not all of our body
	is at the rim, I (within TTC) use an "effective G
	rating", which is about 40%. The effective G rating is what I estimate is
	determining what the effective G forces are which are applying a higher
        blood pressure to our heads. Fighter pilots (who train to counter
        effect the side effects daily) red out at -3 Gs sustained for about
        45 seconds. It's quite a lot to say we sustain -8 Gs for 30 seconds
        daily with little or no side effects. This doesn't have anything to
        do with the force we feel pulling our heads back (which is about the
        G stated not the effective G), just the effect on our blood pressure
        in our heads . I am much more concerned with blowing blood vessels in
        our head than working out our necks.
