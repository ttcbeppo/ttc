        The "B" cup was the first cup we went really fast in (actually it was
        the pink but that was before TTC R&D even existed, when the only ones
        in the group was Brian, Kevin, Lani, and I think Konrad). It was in
        the "B" cup which me and Les pulled a .50 with 2
        <A HREF = "defs.htm">
          dead people
        </A>
        in it! The fastest anyone has been clocked at. But that record was
        recorded with a
        <A HREF = "timethds.htm">
        "class 1"
        </A>
        timing method by Chris (Chef), so the
        accuracy is sort of debatable. Chris however did say that it was a
        little conservative. So there is even a possibility we went SUB
        .50!!! That however is very very VERRY fast. The G's would be above
        12 at our heads. We did get an injury out of that run. A guy we
        took got severe red eye, he had a headache, and his vision turned
        blue. Every one seems to respond to red eye differently in our
        experience (which doesn't come close to fighter pilots, see the
        <A HREF = "gs.htm">
          Gs page
        </A>
        for more on red eye).
        We, however, were really really 
        <A HREF = "defs.htm">
          on
        </A>
        that night. That was most likely the longest either of us have ever
        pulled. That was even before they took the cup out. It was gone for a few
        months, then it came back lighter and faster then ever. However that
        was when we were so out of shape we couldn't pull all that fast ('course
        we still are). But anyway... the record still lies, debatable as it
        may be, I am still damn proud of it.

        Me and Brian were testing timing hardware around 11:00 pm and we were
        blown away by these two guys who we got behind in line (us four were
        the only ones in line) and one said to the other the fast cup was
        first the pink then the purple. Me and Brian (as we usually do when
        someone else actually DOES know what they are talking about when they
        talk about the cups) just looked at each other with open jaws. We knew
        the purple was the fastest, but we had seen that the pink was doing well
	that night. But we still figured they had ridden it once and pulled good
	and convinced themselves it was fast but felt that they, in actuality, didn't know what
	they were talking about. When we got on,
        they were in front of us and picked the pink and we rode the purple.
        So far that night we had probably made six runs, all in
        <A HREF = "defs.htm">
          the zone
        </A>
        while inside the cup upside down paying attention to the stubborn
        hardware. So we were tired and feeling disoriented and queezy so we just watched.
	the other guys got about a .70 - .65!. We then went on that cup. Tired and
        sick bearly pulling at all, we ran about a .60! Insanely fast for two people
	who were tired as can be. It's been fast ever
        seince. Maybe not as fast as that night but pretty damn fast.

        For some reason we really never went on the purple cup other then to
        test for new fast cups. Then one time I went on this cup and smoked.
        All through out the development period of the timing hardware it was
        the fastest cup available. So the hardware, while works ok on every
        cup weve tested on, it is designed to and works perfect on the purple
        cup.

        This cup hasn't held any records but when all the fastest cups are
        going slow or taken, this cup is a good alternative.

        The green cup, AKA the "A" cup was the cup we made the most record
        runs in.  We probably made around 500 sub
        .75 runs in this cup. The handle was replaced quit a while ago with
        one with a sharp edge on it. It still has really low drag and it's
        pretty light, it's just that it's handle will rip your hand apart
        in 3/4 of a run if you pull like us.
        <P>
        The Green cup is  the reason we used to call ourselves Team Green.
        It's also the reason all the T-Cups you'll see on our pages are green.
        When TTC was first starting to become a team, I tried the green cup
        and it was screamin (there was only one then, which one it is now your
        guess is as good as mine) and I ran to get everyone else to try it out.
	 Previously we had exclusively and religiously
        used the blue cup. But the green cup was proving to be consistently
        faster than the blue for months at a time, so it became our #1 cup,
        the blue our #2 cup (hence their "A" and "B" designation). We
        called the fastest guys (me, Kevin, and Brian) team green, and the
        slower bunch (Eric, Aaron, Greg, Chris, and everyone else) team blue.
        After a while people started not showing up to D-land for one reason
        or another (passes running out was the #1 reason) and the team shrunk
        to what is now on the
        <A HREF = "members.htm">
          members
        </A>
         page, and so we just called ourselves Team
        Green. Later to become Team T-Cups 'cause Team Green is what
        everyone calls Kawasakis teams.

        This is a cup that doesn't always go fast.I rode it on 6-22-98 and
        it might have bein faster than the purple cup. I had gone on
        5 or 6 runs and my hands were killing me so it was really hard to go
        all that fast. I could however feel about how fast it was. It felt
        heavy but it had low drag. We saw everyone else pull around 1.00 or
        mabee a little less that day. It had potential for a .65 run.
