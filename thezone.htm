      The zone is an area of speed between about 1.0 - .85 . It's the only speed
	you actually get sick in. Below it there isn't enough speed to have an
	effect. Above it your whole brain just kind of looses track of everything
	else and you just go into your own world.
	<P>
	When I first went fast I felt
	an interesting thing unrelated to the zone but I thought was note worthy.
	The effect of the Gs pulling you backward makes the appearance of the entire
	world rotating forwards so you feel like you and the cup and everything else
	is pointing up like you are leaning back. After a
	while of making runs I stopped noticing this.
	<P>
	While in the zone, life is excruciatingly painful. It WILL be the most
      excruciating 90 seconds of your life. We try very very  hard to stay out of
      this speed by accelerating through it quickly. If we are too tired to get
      passed the zone we will stop immediately. Only one time can I remember not
      stopping the run. Me and Eric were hanging out at the cups (like there is a
      time when we aren't) and two little girls (`bout 12 - 13 yrs old) came up
      to us and asked if we would take them on a run. And we really can't say no
      to our fans. So after about 4 runs so far that night, with Erics hand
      ripped open, and me being pretty tired, we took them on a run. 90 seconds
      in the zone. The worst run ever done by TTC. The worst part of it is we
      don't often get fans coming up to us and ask us for a ride. We hadn't had
      anyone ask us in months, and when we finally did we spent it all in the
      zone. They thought it was the fastest anyone had ever gone before and
      loved every minute of it, but we were in intense pain. Only about 4 times
      has any member of TTC thrown up after a run. Usually we feel better after
      a run (no one actually believes that but it is true). But on account of the
      zone I have thrown up 4 times myself. I did that night.
