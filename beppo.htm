      I am the author of the first web site, from the start page to the
      definitions. Thats right I am the original web master behind T-cups. I
      am also the one to bring cutting edge technology to T-cups. From being
      the first to time a cup with a
      <A HREF = "timethds.htm">
        class 1
      </A>
      timing method (I had to teach every one what 
      <A HREF="timethds.htm">
        seven-o
      </A>
      meant), and the first to suggest using a laptop to time accurately. And
      you know Brian laughed at me when I suggested that. The programmer
      behind T-cup Timerxx.EXE. Well after a while he began to think "Ya know? Maybe
      that would be cool!". Hell it took quite a few minutes for everyone to
      stop laughing when I suggested a web page. But then Konrad said "Wait I
      have drag and drop software (Netscape Navigator Gold)". "Maybe it would
      be cool to have T-cups.com". So a night was spent making a page (most of
      it trying to get a font right for a gif that wasn't even to be used).
      <P>

      That page was ok looking I guess, but no one knew how to make links. In
      fact no one knew a single tag of HTML (I'm still the only one, besides
      Brian).  Take it upon me to learn the language just for T-cups.com
      (however it's not all that much a language as a couple of tags put in
      the text for formatting).
      <P>

      So here we are the only page devised around a sport (hey technically
      it could be) that has absolutely no chance of making any money. But it
      sure is cool being the best, most famous riders of the most famous ride
      of the most famous theme park in the world.
