      What we eat plays a very important part of going fast. The food that we
      eat must give us enough energy to last not only for all of our runs 
      through a night, but also give us the energy to last through any other 
      activities we happen to partake in while at Disneyland. All of the foods
      which we regularly eat must be high energy foods. Not only do the foods
      we eat give us quite a bit of energy but also all are quite tasty. Here
      is a small list of some of the places we like to get things to eat or
      drink and reasons why we as a team like these places.

          Jet Pizza
        </H1>
        Located in Costa Mesa CA
	  <BR>
	  (no longer owned by the same people and no where near as good as it used to be)
      </DIV>
      <P>
 
	One of our favorite places to eat before leaving to make runs is Jet
      Pizza. The pizza made here is the best in all of California,
      probably all of the North American continent (I'm sure there is a
      better pizza place in Sicily but they wont deliver to California in less than 30
      min.) The pizza gives us optimum energy to pull and will usually keep
      us pumped enough to pull quite a few runs throughout the night. Jet
      also helps to stabilize our stomachs. Throwing up on a run, while it
      hasn't yet happened, would not be a good thing.

          Cappuccino from 7-11
        </H1>
        Located...anywhere
      </DIV>
      <P>

      Running around D-Land going on rides, not to mention pulling on the
      cups, can really wear you out. It's very important to have not just
      enormous amounts of caffeine but lots of sugar. And 7-11 cappuccino is
      loaded with both. It's cheap and on the way.

          Carls Jr.
        </H1>
        Located all over the western US
      </DIV>
      <P>

      Our primary food source, Carls Jr. may not be available in your neck of
      the woods, but if they are you know what we mean. If not, when in
      California you must hit em' up. Anything on the menu is fine, but a
      Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger will keep ya going for many hours. Not
      to mention it's the absolute most delicious hamburger on the planet.

          Carnation Gardens ice cream
        </H1>
        Located in Disneyland near The Center
      </DIV>
      <P>

      Most people think if you pay for something in Disneyland, it'll be
      terribly expensive. But that is not always the case. Carnation Gardens
      proves this. Their ice cream is, belive it or not, a very good deal in
      or out of D-land. In my opinion it is bigger per scoop and better
      tasting than Baskin Robins ice cream and really close to the same
      price, if not less expensive, I'm not sure. Many times me and Brian
      would meet in the gardens after work and just hang out and eat the
      tasty ice cream for an hour or two, perhaps make a run, and then go
      home. That, as far as I am concerned, was alone worth the value of my
      pass. I am also helping out D-land.

      The greatest skewers in the world. A bit pricey, they are well worth it.
      Also very good is the iced cappuccino. Also a bit pricey, they are also
      worth the higher price. They are about double than for one of the
      same size from a coffee shop and triple that of 7-11s cappuccino. While
      you can put ice in it, 7-11 doesn't have the whipped cream, cinnamon,
      and stuff.
