      Disney, Disneyland, Mad Hatter Tea Party, Tomarrowland, Tomarrowland
      Terrace, and I'm sure many more names I've used here most likely belong
      to the Walt Disney Co. All other names are those of their respective
      owners.
      <P>

      Team T-cups and TTC R&D are in no way affiliated with Disneyland or The
      Walt Disney Co.
      <P>

      All images were (obviously, I mean no one would copy images as cheesy as
      these) created by TTC exept for that image on the start page that says
      "Made with Microsoft Notepad.exe" (this is entirely true by the way :-)
      I don't know who made that one. I copied it off some warez site a few
      years back. If you were the original creator and you would like me to
      take some kind of action regarding it please email me. If for nothing
      else so I know somebody actually read my page hehe. The same goes for
      anyone else who feels we are infringing on their copy write please email
      me and tell me the action you would like me to take.
      <P>

      We wait in line like everyone else and get no special privileges.
      <P>

      We keep our hands and feet inside the ride and keep our head tilted
      slightly foreward at all times.
      <P>

      We always eat our veggies.
      <P>

      We chew our food 32 times before swallowing.
      <P>

      We always come to a complete stop at a stop sign.
      <P>
