          G forces: the reason fast is fast

      Without the severe G forces we would be able to go much faster than we
      do. Anyone can deal with the spinning and not get dizzy or sick, as long
      as your past the zone. But it gets real hard to pull when the Gs mount
      up. First reason is you cant get in and pull. At a .65 the Gs pulling
      you outward are up to 5, which means your torso weighs 600 lbs. Depending
      on which method you use this can put a real damper in your ability to
      move forward to get in. Brian M uses a technique where he leans against
      the back of the cup. This way he has alot less effect of the Gs. But he
      has really long arms, so we cant all use that method. But gs ripping you
      toward the outside is the biggest problem we face toward going fast.
      <P>

      Perhaps the worst limitation Gs provide, is the added blood pressure
      toward the rear of your body, which is the center of your back. This
      provides a large portion of force squeezing in your lungs, making it
      very hard to breath. One of the most common reasons we stop a run, is
      someone says they cant breath. We have pretty much adopted the
      breathing methods of fighter pilots, to counter act this.

      <P>

      Another limiting factor, is the fear of falling out. Falling out flat out
      sucks. I've done it myself, and it can get pretty hairy if you aren't
      careful. When your not pulling "grab the lip". Reach down between your legs
      and grab the edge of the seat and don't let go. We ALWAYS make sure we "have
      a lip" before the run starts. If we don't it can get a little hairy
      sometimes, when we start to slip out.

	One bad thing about gs is "redeye". This is a phenomenon that happens when blood is forced into the
	eyes from excessive blood pressure. It pretty much only happens from Gs. You don't see it with
	SCUBA divers because the pressure is everywhere while with Gs it is only around the edges and back
	and not the front.
