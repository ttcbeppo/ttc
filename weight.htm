      Going fast on the cups, actually takes a lot of skill. It really
      doesn't matter how strong you are. In fact the bigger you are the
      heavier you are. The heavier you are the more drag there is on the
      bearings, the more weight there is to accelerate, and the more likely
      you are to have the weight off center, which loads the bearings more
      causing more drag. All these cause enough drag to overpower the extra
      force the puller might have. Anthony was a pretty big guy and his arms
      really didn't move all that fast. He had a lot of force on the bottom
      end, but once the cup got moving someone with longer arms had to get in
      and pull. Les weighs like around 100 lbs and has toothpicks for arms. I
      weigh 135 and don't have much more, yet he and I were in the fastest cup
      ever recorded. A .50 with 2 dead people inside. Now that's not to say
      it's not really cool riding with the equivalent of a 426 hemi. Once me
      and Michigan Torque went an a run together and when he started out I
      actually slid across the seat with each pull! That was cool! But we
      didn't go all that fast. There was just too much drag. It's cool riding
      with someone real big once in a while, but (as in my racing) I prefer
      the equivalent of little 2-strokes. That's the fastest way. I haven't
      seen what the cups have for bearings yet. I don't know if they are
      plain, or ball, or roller. They feel like they have plastic ball
      bearings when they are worn out and shake the cup, but it could be
      because the gel coat plain bearings have crumbled. If the bearings were
      ball or roller it really wouldn't matter how much you weigh except for
      accelerating which only accounts for about an estimated 30% of the mid speed drag.
