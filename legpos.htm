        <H1>Leg positioning</h1><hr>
          There isn't much to say about this, but I thought it was so important that I would make
	a page about it.
	<P>Each person has their own way of placing their legs depending on how they pull. Often they
	will move their legs during a run. It's kind of dangerous doing this cause moving around you can
	slip out and catapult yourself into the surrounding fence, but when using a "back thrust" method
	your legs will be forward under the seat lip opposing you. When leaning forward twisting the
	wheel like a steering wheel, your feet are usually under you. That also is nice because if you loose
	your seating you have your heels under the lip of the seat to hold you in. But no matter what, it
	is a highly personal aspect that everyone kind of chooses themselves. Basically, just make sure
	your legs are not touching the wheel and don't hurt anybody.
        As I mentioned, Your leg positioning can make it so you don't fly out too. If your feet are in front
	of you, you can wrap your heels around the center post to stop you from flying out.
