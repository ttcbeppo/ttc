      This run was the absolute greatest run in T-Cup history! It wasn't the
      fastest we've ever gone but it had the most applause, was the fastest
      run we got on tape (meaning recorded with TCT), and everyone was there
      to see it. We figure we have to about a .57 or so, you decide for your
      self.
